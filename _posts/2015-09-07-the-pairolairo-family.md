And what kind of depravity are they engaged in? The Pairolairo family crest is a sword suspended amidst a laurel wreath; while many things about the Pairolairos are shrouded in rumour and speculation, there is no doubt that a large part of their wealth comes from the exclusive access to the storied "Green Granite" mines found only on their estate. Craftsmen the world over can be found travelling to the Pairolairo estates, begging for a special disposition of green granite stone for one project or another.

Of course, upon entering any of their estates, one is greeted by the family crest inlaid into a large slab of this precious material in the main foyer. This ostentatious display has caused the family no end of frustration and anger by those who feel the highly-prized stone should be made more accessible to the public, and that the Pairolairos are using their exclusive access to the rock to artifically inflate the market.

While the adventurers have had some interactions with the Pairolairo family, it's yet to be seen how much this mysterious and powerful family will affect them in the days and weeks to come.
