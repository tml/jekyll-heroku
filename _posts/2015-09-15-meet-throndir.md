*Sketch bond: Sketch does not understand life in the wild, so I will teach them.*

*Eero bond: Eero has guided me before and I owe him for it.*

It is a truism that all elves love the wilds; making thier homes in the deep forests of the world, they commune with nature on a level most races will never understand. But even among these sylvan folk, there is occasionally one born who is so peregrine that they find themselves compelled to withdraw even from their
arboreous kin. Of such is Throndir the ranger.

Perhaps it started with Ladriel Stormwood. Throndir and Ladriel were children together in their small elven community of Kilshade, buried deep in the Boarsweld Forest. Although the Stormwoods were minor royalty, Throndir's father was a powerful druid, the Kilshade Tree-singer, and his mother Khirral was a popular cou
rt poet and minstrel, so the two often found themselves in close interaction. Ladriel was a spoiled, vengeful child who continually found himself inexplicably jealous of the quiet certitude and personal sense of well-being that Throndir - even from a young age - seemed to carry himself with, and this sparked a bitter
 rivalry that would haunt Throndir throughout his youth.

Throndir began to range further and further afield, spending ever less time inside the towering tree-homes of Kilshade, and ever more wandering the wilds and befriending the woodland creatures; and Ladriel grew ever more jealous, vindictive, and petty. Had any of their parents paid attention to what was going on, per
haps they could have halted the now-inevitable confrontation, but it was not to be.

Each spring, the professional socieites of Kilshade had apprenticeship trials; hopeful elven youth would gather and compete in a series of competitive events designed by the society in question to try their aptitude and capacity for success; only the most proficient would be accepted as apprentices. The most prestigi
ous of all the apprenticeships was the Ranger Corps. Approaching the trials in his 85th year, it was well known that Throndir had the inside track on winning the position with the Corps, and that he would be by far the youngest elf to ever do so.

Ladriel couldn't allow this; thinking to take the position (and the prestige) for himself, Ladriel attempted to drug a bear that he had been assigned to "hunt," hoping it make it docile and easier to track. Unfortunately, caution and attention had never been Ladriel's strong suits, and he choose his drugs poorly. Whe
n the bear was released for Ladriels hunt, instead of being docile, the bear turned vicious and attacked the onlookers. This had not been Throndir's hunt, so he had left his own weaponry at home, but seeing the danger others were in, Throndir lept into action, improvising weapons from the shattered pieces of fence wh
ere the bear had crashed through. In the commotion, Ladriel fled the scene, fearing the consequences of his actions.

Throndir incapacitated the bear, but not before it had done severe damage to Throndir's arms, leaving him horribly scarred. Soon after he was healed, Throndir called for an inquest into Ladriels' actions that day, only to discover that - during his period of invalidity - Ladriel had been busy framing Throndir's belov
ed sister Kieran for the crime.

Of all his kin, Throndir only ever felt any real closeness with his older sister Kieran; where their mother was prone to getting lost in her own mind, working on her latest composition, Kieran was conscientious and filled with the present, and often took care of her younger brother. Rather than see her be blamed for
something he knew she had not (and would not have) done, Throndir tendered a false confession, putting the blame on himself and forever eliminating himself from the ranks of the Ranger Corps. His only dream in life shattered beyond recompense, Throndir escaped even more often, and for longer periods, to the depths of
 the Weld.

He soon came to regret his long and many departures, for it was during one of these extended outings that Throndir and Kieran's father, Tanyl, saw the opportunity to improve his family's lot by marrying Kieran to the Stormwood heir. Knowing in his heart that Ladriel was culpable for the drugging of the bear, and not
being able to stand by and watch his beloved sister marry his worst enemy, Throndir decided he'd had all he could take, and fled from Kilshade, stopping only to say goodbye to his sister. Kieran told her brother she understood, and hugged him, but deep in her heart she knew this would be the last time she ever saw hi
m.

Wanting to put some distance between himself and this painful union, Throndir headed out of the Boarsweld Forest. After several weeks of somewhat aimless wandering, he found himself being drawn ever westward until he came to the edge of a living Forest. Continuing to follow the pull, he was brought to a gigantic Worl
d Tree, one of the ancient trees dating back to the birth of the world. He made himself a small shelter nearby and began caring for the forest.

Only 90 years old, Throndir was - at best - in late adolescence for an elf, and was generally not very wise in the ways of the human world, and so it was that - after several years of solitude in his new forst home - Throndir found himself being hunted by a group of humans. After days of being chased, and finding him
self consistently surprised at their woodcraft, he decided to face his pursuers, who told him was under arrest for poaching and loitering on the land of a family of humans named the Arkosians.

The men who had "captured" him were actually fairly reasonable men who themselves loved the woods, and Throndir was able to explain that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding; the World Tree had called, and he had instinctively responded, not realizing this was property someone owned. The Wardens gave him a map
 to the metropolis where the Arkosian estates were held, and a letter of introduction, explaining how impressed they were with his stewardship of the Black Forest (for such had the world of men named this place,) and recommending he be employed as a member of their unit. And thus Throndir found himself on the road to
 Cumorah.

Arriving in the city, he was astounded at the press of humanity, and almost immediately he became the victim of a pickpocket. A quick, friendly halfling leaped to his aid, stopping the pickpocket in a very dramatic fashion and drawing a cloud of onlookers. The halfling himself seemed quite distracted and he accidentl
y let the would-be thief make his escape, but the criwd ariund them quickly dissapated. Throndir briefly explained who he was and what he was doing in Cumorah, and the halfling guided Throndir through the city and introduced him to "my good friend Eero, priest of Cornforth, or something like that."

Eero, a large, burly human with a shockingly bald head, directed a deep frown at the halfling. "HIS name is Sketch, and he's not half as funny as he thinks himself. Who are you, friend, and how can I be of assistance?" Throndir glanced around, noting that Sketch had somehow slipped away unnoticed.

"Yes, he does that. Now, how may I help you, friend?‚Äù

Throndir told Eero of his goal to get hired by the Arkosians as a Warden of the Black Forest. Eero led Throndir through the city to the gates of the Arkosian estates, and waited until Throndir came out, triumphant.

Over the next few years, the three became fast friends; and, whenever the Wardens needed someone to go to Cumorah for supplies, or to present a detailed report to the Arkosians, Throndir volunteered and spent the time in the city with his two friends.

During this time, he also had a few opportunities to interact with Eero's superior, Joshua the High Cleric; Throndir found Joshua quite difficult to get along with, as Joshua often preached that the Black Forest should be torn down and turned into fertile farmlands and cities, where more people would be drawn, so tha
t he might preach to a wider audience about the mercies and power of Odin. While Throndir had no specific complaints against Odin, he was not fond of the idea of the beautiful woods being destroyed in the name of "progress."

Two nights ago, while making his usual rounds through the forest, Throndir came upon the most grisly and gruesome scene he'd ever seen; a large black circle of burned forest, nearly two miles across, was littered with the skinned corpses of nearly every kind of wildlife imaginable. Throndir was both heart-broken and
angered at the waste and destruction, and he searched the area carefully, finding only a single piece of evidence: a ring with a family crest of some sort on it - a sword suspended between two laurel leaves.

Making his way to Steading Shadeguard to see what the local constabulary might know of the symbol, Throndir ran into his friend Eero, who was in the area seeking the wisdom of his former mentor, Thurban Bearclaw. As the continued on toward the Steading, just as they were considering setting up camp for the night, the
y ran into Sketch and a member of the Shadeguard City Watch, Officer Hobbes. Throndir described the scene, and Officer Hobbes took possession of the ring and hurried back to Shadeguard to discover what others may know about it. While Sketch seemed a bit shaken and immediately got very quiet at seeing the symbol on th
e ring, Throndir assumed his friend would share his thoughts when the time was right, and the three friends made camp for the night, determined to wait there until Officer Hobbes returned with more information.
